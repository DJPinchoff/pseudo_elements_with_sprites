# Pseudo Elements with Sprite Images

Completed for Course 201 in Launch School. This is my attempt at recreating the final product that can be viewed here: http://d3jtzah944tvom.cloudfront.net/lesson_3/pseudo_elements/index_v2.html



## HTML/CSS Notes of Interest
Given an `icons_nav.png` and `icons_social.png`, I created this webpage with a header, main, and footer elements laid out in a 3-column layout within the body.

I added CSS to change the background position of the sprite for each link based on a class that I added to the anchors, then I changed the background position again when the link is hovered for the `icons_nav.png`.

The `icons_social.png` is used to place the appropriate icon to the left of the text within each link in the footer. You'll notice that the icons are much larger than the ones in the header. To bring them back down to the same approximate size, I used CSS `background-size` property.
